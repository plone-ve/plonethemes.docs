.. _bootstrap-css-framework:

Bootstrap CSS framework
-----------------------

The :ref:`diazoframework.bootstrap <diazoframework-bootstrap>` package that 
integrates the `Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ 
into Plone.


About Twitter Bootstrap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web 
development.

By nerds, for nerds: Built Twitter by @mdo and @fat, Bootstrap utilizes 
:ref:`LESS <less>` CSS, is compiled via Node, and is managed through GitHub 
to help nerds do awesome stuff on the web. 

Made for everyone: :ref:`Bootstrap CSS framework <bootstrap-css-framework>` 
was made to not only look and behave great in the latest desktop browsers 
(as well as IE7!), but in tablet and smartphone browsers via responsive CSS 
as well.

Packed with features: A 12-column responsive grid, dozens of components,
JavaScript plugins, typography, form controls, and even a web-based Customizer
to make Bootstrap your own.

.. _cascade-css-framework:

Cascade framework
-----------------

The :ref:`diazotheme.framework.cascade <diazotheme-framework-cascade>` package 
that integrates the `Cascade framework <http://www.cascade-framework.com/>`_ 
into Plone.


About Cascade framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Feature Rich
    Semantic and non-semantic grid layouts, base templates, table designs, navigation 
    elements, typography and lots, lots more.

Universal
    Build high performance websites in no time for old browers and new browsers alike 
    without worrying about browser quirks.

Atomic
    An optimised atomic design gives you full control of the look and feel of your site 
    while keeping code bloat minimal.

Modular
    Don't need certain features? Don't include them. Unlike other frameworks, you can 
    include only the components you need.

Although the overall look and feel are most definitely inspired by Twitter Bootstrap, 
Cascade framework is not just another Bootstrap clone. Where Twitter Bootstrap puts its 
focus on delivering shiny user elements that can be dropped into any project and takes 
control of your project's overall look-and-feel, Cascade Framework is intended to do the 
opposite. By splitting your CSS into separate files based on features rather than selectors 
as well as by implementing atomic design, Cascade Framework puts you in control!

Also different from Twitter Bootstrap or other CSS Frameworks out there, Cascade Framework 
can be used for modern browsers and older browsers alike. All features of Cascade Framework support Internet Explorer from IE6 upwards or degrade gracefully. With Cascade Framework you 
no longer have to choose between supporting only modern browsers or downgrading your design.
